AvaIre Auto Update
=====================

Auto Update makes staying up to date with all the latest features super easy, the plugin will periodically check if a new version of the nightly build is out, and if one is out, it will initialize an update.

> **Note:** This plugin will not work without using [Watchdog](https://github.com/avaire/watchdog), the plugin only initializes the update process, [Watchdog](https://github.com/avaire/watchdog) is what actually updates the bot. 

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avaire/auto-update-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.

And you're done!
